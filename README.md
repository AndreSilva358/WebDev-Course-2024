# The-Complete-2024-Web-Development-Bootcamp
 This is the repository containing codes from a webdev course I took by The App Brewery, taught by Dr Angela Yu.

 In the future I plan on dividing the folders by their respective sections, or at the very least by the general topic to which they belong to (such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WebDesign, etc).
